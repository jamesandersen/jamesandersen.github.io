This was a question posed to me by a friend several months ago as I was first getting up to speed on the Adobe Flex platform and expressing some enthusiasm.  At the time no immediate answer came to mind.  I had just finished up some AJAX work and knew that AJAX is a powerful approach to building rich user-experiences and I scarcely knew the Flex platform had to offer.  Today I ran across a post from [EffectiveUI](http://www.effectiveui.com/blogs/?p=133) that really lays out the advantages of each technology and when it makes sense to use each.  Well Done!

Also, I've come across several apps that demonstrate the kind of functionality would be either impossible or prohibitively expensive to develop in AJAX/HTML:




  * [Picnik](http://www.picnik.com/app)-an online image editing service that integrates with Flickr, Picasa, and others


  * [Papervision3D](http://papervision3d.org/)--Open source 3D engine for the Flash player

	
  * [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance?client=ig&q=XOM)-The stock chart here is built on the flash platform
