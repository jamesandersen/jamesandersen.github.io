As many as times as I've scoured the web looking for free audio books I don't know how I managed to miss [LibriVox](http://librivox.org/) until recently!  This is a great site for those who can appreciate classic literature, poetry, and anything else in the public domain but have little time for reading.  Summarily, the concept is this:  volunteers record themselves reading the text of public domain works and the recordings are aggregated into freely available audio books!

I just recently finished [Robert Louis Stevenson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson)'s adventure masterpiece [Treasure Island](http://librivox.org/treasure-island-dramatic-reading-by-robert-louis-stevenson/).  Shiver me timbers!

    <p>I went out on a limb and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silver-Return-Treasure-Andrew-Motion/dp/0307884872" target="_blank">Silver</a> a sequel to <i>Treasure Island</i>.  I actually really enjoyed it!</p>
